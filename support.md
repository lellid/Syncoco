Syncoco is free software!
Syncoco is an Open Source project,
that is covered under the [GNU Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
As such, your main form of support for Syncoco will be through Github's [issue list](https://github.com/lellid/Syncoco/issues). 

In addition, Github has bug tracking capabilities, so please report any bugs [here](https://github.com/lellid/Syncoco/issues).
Wish list items will also be considered, but I make absolutely no promises.
