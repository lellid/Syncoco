## Welcome to the Syncoco project page!

Syncoco is a very special and very useful file synchronization program, using a USB memory stick.

Ever had the problem that you want to synchronize files between two computers, which are either:
- not connected by a network
- connected, but the connection is slow
- you have an aweful lot of files, so it would take days to sync your files
- connected, but you don't want to transfer your data over that wire

Then Syncoco may be right for you! No installation required! 
Give it a try and [download it from SourceForge!](https://sourceforge.net/projects/syncoco/)
