- Syncoco is written in C#, you need the .NET framework to run it. But fortunately, on
- most of Windows PCs, .NET framework 4 is already installed!
- Starting from version 1.0.6, you need the .NET framework 4 client profile (previous versions required the .NET framework 1.1).
- Just download the Syncoco-1.0.6.msi file and double click it!
- For those who have not already installed the .NET framework 4 client profile: during the installation you will be requested to install it, and will be guided through the installation process of .NET framework 4 client profile.
- After the .NET framework 4 client profile was successfully installed, double click the Syncoco-1.0.6.msi file again to resume the installation process of Syncoco.
